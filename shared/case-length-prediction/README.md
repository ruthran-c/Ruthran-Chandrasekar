# Case Length Prediction
Here is the link to the blog talking about Hospital IQ's surgery case length predictor and the case booking workflow that was built around it:
> [In the OR, Accuracy in Scheduling is Everything â€“ Hospital IQ](https://www.hospiq.com/blog/in-the-or-accuracy-in-scheduling-is-everything/)

**Note:** Since the acquisition of Hospital IQ by LeanTaaS, access to the website is limited with a pop-up message obstructing the blog entry; 
there are a couple of ways to circumvent and read the article:
1. Using Safari's 'Reader View' should work around the pop-up and allow a seamless reading experience.
2. Using the print option in your browser with `CMD+P` or under options "File -> Print" should also work.

Alternatively, you can download a copy that I have stored in my [Storage drive](http://potfolio.ruthran.fastmail.com/shared/).

Happy Reading!
